ToDo-List:

	2.2.0 -
	
	Change Max/TemporaryCurrent values to float %
	
	Try changing the character information passing to references,
	this should help boost fps since the data doesn't has to be copied anymore. (Also for saving)
	
	Transfer limits and default values to settings-definitions.as

	Remove Color By Value

	############################

	Add tooltips for Custom Colors page
	Add saving mechanism for Custom Colors

	Minimap

	Co-Op Support:
	
		ScaleWithDistanceToPlayer
			uses the camera position now, not the enemy position.
			This might result in the enemy panels being too smal when the players are far apart.
		
		ShowEnemyPanelsOnlyOnVisibleContact
			uses the player1 position, this would result in weird behavior
			when Co-Op is enabled. Maybe use the camera position or check for each character?
			Last option will bring the performance to its knees.

		ShowEnemyPanelsAlsoForAllies
			could get confused in Co-Op since players can be on the same team, or on different teams.
			
		The order of the boolean checks (scale with distance, show on player, ...) matters in Co-Op since
		enemies can be on different teams.
		
		Add Option to show only player 1, all players, or none on Co-Op.


	Enemy Panels:
	
		Fix the statusbar panel jittering by getting the intermediate coordinates between frames. But how?
		
		Place the panels perfectly on the head of the enemies considering their size and species.
		Could use the bone position but that would result in the jittering talked above.



Possible Future Endeavours (in no special order):

	Damage Numbers
	Extending it to a full on tactical combat mod
	
	More player styles



Warning:

	Using .setElement on guiHud.getMain() will conflict with an other element that set itself there already.
	That's the reason why we use addFloatingElement throughout the whole mod.
